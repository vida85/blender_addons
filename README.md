A basic city random generator that I'll be updating every so often.

Blueprint City Generator

Blueprint is a sophisticated random generator for urban buildings is now available @ www.gumroad.com

Cities are built on a grid system, and the values are defined by the number of buildings in the city, the  height, and their density.
The buildings that Blueprint has built are extremely close to the real size, with all buildings having the same texture. You can texture the entire city in seconds and spend time customizing the buildings for better results. We will continue to improve this and add more building details.
